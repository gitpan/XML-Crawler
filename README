XML-Crawler version 0.01
========================

Honestly, I'm a little embarassed to add yet another module to
the crowded XML namespace. I wrote this for myself because it 
seems everyone was writing XML modules that didn't do quite what
I want.

What I want:

  my $hash_ref = xml_to_rh( $xml );

Yes, it's true that XML doesn't conveniently translate to Perl 
data structures. But it's also true that one doesn't necessarily 
need a perfect translation much of the time.
